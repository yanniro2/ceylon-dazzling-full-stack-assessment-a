Assignment: A
 

Task Description: Your task is to build a user registration and login system using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), TypeScript, and Next.js. The system should allow users to register, login, and view their profile.

 

The following features should be implemented:

 

1. User Registration:

·         Implement a registration form where users can enter their username, email, and password.

·         Validate user input to ensure all required fields are provided and follow any necessary constraints.

·         Store the user information securely in a MongoDB database using Mongoose or a similar ODM.

 

2. User Login:

·         Implement a login form where users can enter their email and password.

·         Authenticate the user's credentials against the stored user information in the MongoDB database.

·         Use session management or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to maintain user authentication.

 

3. User Profile:

·         Create a user profile page that displays the user's username and email.

·         Ensure that only authenticated users can access and view their own profile page.

 

4. UI Design and Responsiveness:

·         Implement a responsive UI design using React.js or a UI library/framework of your choice.

·         Ensure that the application looks good and is usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

 

You should focus on creating a functional system within the given time constraint. You may use any appropriate libraries or frameworks to expedite the development process.
